HOW TO USE:

- create a folder <pdbs_folder> with pdbs (each pdb contains a antigen and nanobody, the nanobody chain is H)

Modeling:

- run "python3 NanoModelBatch.py <pdbs_folder>"  (run it in some cluster, do ssh hm first)
- run "python3 NanobodySelector.py <pdbs_folder>"
- run "python3 NanoModelAnalyzer.py <pdbs_folder> <soap_score\dope_score>" if you want to get plots and charts with the modeling data.
    options:
        -s : saves sumery plots and creats summry csv
        -b : saves box plots of length against rmsd
        -p : saves points plots, gets number of pdbs to plot


Docking:

- run "python3 CrossLinksMaker.py <pdbs_folder>" for generating cross links (run it in some cluster, do ssh hm first)
- run "python3 PyDock.py <pdbs_folder>" for docking.
    options:
        -xl : use cross links for docking (get max number of cross links to use) - use this option only after running
              CrossLinksMaker.py!
- run "python3 DockScoreAnalyzer.py <pdbs_folder>" if you want to get plots and charts with the docking data.
    options:
        - p : plots the summery data"
        - c: use the data after clustering
        - xl: use the data after cross links with <n> cross links (make sure to run CrossLinksMaker.py and PyDock.py
              with -xl=n first)
