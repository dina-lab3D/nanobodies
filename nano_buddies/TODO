1. Nanobody modeling:

    - check why not working: "4LAJ_1", "5J56_1", "5TOK_1", "5U4L_1"  (dina)
    - check why rmsd is high: 5VXL_1, 6ITC_2, 4PIR_1, 4X7C_1  (dina)

    - optimize number of templates for Modeler (now is 10)
    - optimize sequence identity of templates
    - optimize cdr3 boundaries (line 304 ModelNanobody.py)
    - loop modeling for cdr2/cdr1 (check rmsd of cdr2, cdr1 only)

    - chose plots

2. Docking (no xl):

    - top 1, top 10, top 100 - how much for each type (acceptable, etc.)
    - check if a good model in the previous stage helps us in the docking stage

3. Docking (with xl):

    - top 1, top 10, top 100 - how much for each type and for each number of xl.

4. Web Server:

    - create web server program!


5. ideas for improvments: 
	- change the template selection (choose based of amino acids properties)
	- add deep learning for cdr3 modedling?
	- add confidence level for the program results?
	- use 'environmentâ€“specific substitution scores' (ESSS) for template selection.
	- model each cdr sepretly (with different templates)
